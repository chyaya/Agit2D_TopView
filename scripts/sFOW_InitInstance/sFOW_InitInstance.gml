// NOTE! The radius value, along with the tile size that you set,
// will have a SERIOUS impact on performance! While these scripts are
// as optimised as possible, they still require a double "for" loop to go 
// through the tiles and set their alpha while doing collision
// checks. So, change the radius and tile size to get a balance between 
// what looks good and what gives good performance.
