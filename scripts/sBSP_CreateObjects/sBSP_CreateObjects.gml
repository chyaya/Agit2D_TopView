/// @description	This script is for creating the objects in your room. How you 
///					do this will depend largely on what you want and how your game works.
///					For convenience it contains the most required objects by the BSP 
///					engine, which is walls and doors, but you can add further objects easily.
///					For example, you can add values directly to the DS_grid using the 
///					the "count" variable and the room array "r" (see the create event 
///					of "oBSP_Generate" for more info), and then create the instances 
///					by adding a further case.
///					
///					To show you how this would work, the DEMO will create a "player" object 
///					in the center of a random room, as well as spawn a number of "enemy"
///					objects in random rooms. The player object is hard-coded into the script, 
///					simply because you always need to have a player object, but can easily be 
///					substituted for a player spawner or whatever is required.
///					
///					Note that all objects that you wish to spawn WITHOUT the possibility of 
///					an overlap should be children of the object "oBSP_CollisionParent"
///					as the spawning scripts use this for checking. If having two instances 
///					occupy the same space is not an issue, then you need not use this parent.
///					
///					This script also shows how you can use TILES to mark the floors of the 
///					rooms, doors and the corridors. This is an optional extra but works well 
///					and gives a nice touch to the game.

// The following adds the walls, doors and floor tiles for the room using loops.
// As you can see we have two sprites for horizontal and vertical doors (you can 
// easily change this), and we use two different tiles for the floors and corridors.
// This gives a nice graphic touch but is not necessary. Note that the tiles do not 
// have to be square, nor power of two, and the script will stretch them to fit the 
// grid size.

// NOTE! In the demo I have variable cell sizes to show off the engine, so to add
// floor tiles I have to use an ASSET layer and add sprites then scale them. In a
// real game, you will probably have a fixed cell size and use tiles, so I've
// included the tile code too as comments. SImply comment out all the sprite code, 
// and uncomment the tile code to use (and make sure you have a layer for tiles in

// We now call another set of scripts to create different objects. These scripts 
// assume a couple of things:

// 1) the origin of the sprite for the instance being created has been CENTERED

// 2) the instance being created is NOT scaled, so if you need to scale the instance
// use a new sprite resource and scale that then assign it to the object.

// 3) the order in which you create things is VERY important. Those that don't require 
// collision checks (ie: don't use the BSP collision parent) should be created FIRST
// then any essential instances that MUST be in the game are created next (like the BOSS
// in the example script calls below), then finally any other instances. This is because
// the spawn scripts may not spawn 100% of all instances if the room area being spawned 
// in is too small for the number of instances being created. Imagine trying to spawn 
// 2000 enemies in a 5x5 room! 

// NOTE! These scripts given below are examples only to give you an idea of how to go 
// about things. You will have to adjust and change these script arguments to suit your 
// or write your own scripts and call them here...
